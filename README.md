## Introduction

The Sajari React SDK is a library of React Hooks & Components to help build fast and powerful search interfaces.

React provides a simple and elegant way to structure user interfaces. Aside from providing generic UI components, the Sajari React SDK also provides a way to seamlessly integrate the Sajari Search platform into any web-based app through the use of easily composable Components.

There are three main packages allowing you to pick and choose the right solution for your application:

The Sajari React SDK is broken into 4 separate packages:
